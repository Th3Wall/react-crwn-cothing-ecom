## üéØ About ##

I've [bought this course](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-react-developer-redux-hooks-graphql-zero-to-mastery) in order to start from the very beginning by learning the basics of React and then going into advanced topics with the purpose of making good decisions on architecture and tools on any of my future ReactJS projects.<br/><br/>
This project-based course introduced me to all of the modern toolchain of a React developer in 2021.<br/>
Along the way, I have built a full stack app (MERN stack): it's a massive e-commerce application built using React, Redux, React Hooks, React Suspense, React Router, GraphQL, Context API, Firebase, Redux-Saga, Stripe and a lot more technologies.<br/><br/>
